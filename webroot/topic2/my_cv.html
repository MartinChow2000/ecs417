			<h2> Personal Statement </h2>
			<p> I am a kind and honest person who always put other people before myself. This leads me
to be a self-reliant, independent person who always tries to help others with my
knowledge and capability. Completing the Duke of Edinburgh award has gained me
leadership competency as well as excellent communication and negotiation skills to
work as a team. Representing my Secondary School Table Tennis and Sixth Form Football
team taught me the importance of practise and working under pressure to get to the
highest level. My work history has given me many valuable soft skills that I can transfer
into the Computer Science career such as learning the basics of HTML from work
experience, teaching and communicating ideas to people in tutoring and working as a
flexible team member to help my colleagues in Nando’s. </p>
